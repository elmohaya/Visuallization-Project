## Dataset

> This data set is about a GoBike marathon where it indicates several variables such as duration, gender, age, start and end stations, and geographical location. Steps of assessing and cleaning the data were generated such as removing all rows with null values and reindexing.


## Summary of Findings

> The main finding is that the variable that describes the time duration for each ride tends to decrease with age for both genders. Furthermore, more males have participated than females. In addition, start stations and end stations tend to have a different effect on duration variable.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> First, we will try to show how duration is affected by age and then relate those two variables to other variables such as start and end stations and gender.
